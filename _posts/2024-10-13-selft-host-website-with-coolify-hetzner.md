# Self-Host Your Website with Coolify and Hetzner

Iâ€™ve always wanted an easy and straightforward solution to host my Next.js websites independently, away from platforms like Netlify, Vercel, or Render. Recently, I saw some people on X (formerly Twitter) talking about Coolifyâ€”and it was exactly what I was looking for! ðŸ˜„

## What is Coolify?

Coolify is a free, open-source tool that allows you to easily self-host applications, databases, or services (like WordPress, Formbricks, and Grafana) without needing to manage servers yourself.

## Why Choose Hetzner?

In short, itâ€™s cost-effective, and Hetzner recently added a one-click Coolify installation, saving time and hassle.

## Prerequisites

Before you start, make sure you have the following:

- A domain name (I got mine from Porkbun)
- A Hetzner Cloud server (I chose the â‚¬4.51/month option)
- A Git repository for your project on GitHub or GitLab

## Step 1: Setting Up Your Domain

For domains, I recommend Porkbun or Namecheap as they offer competitive prices.

## Step 2: Create a Hetzner Server

After signing in to Hetzner, follow these steps:

1. Go to **Project > New Project**, name your project, and click **Add Project**.
2. Open the new project, click on **Create Resource** at the top right, and select **Servers**.

**Server Configuration:**

- Choose **Server Location** (note that prices vary by location).
- For the Image, go to the **Apps** tab and select **Coolify**.
- Choose **Server Type** based on your needs.
- Set **Volume Storage** to at least 30GB (I added 40GB for â‚¬1.76/month).

Minimum Specifications for Coolify: 2 vCPUs, 2GB RAM, and 30+ GB storage.

Once configured, click **Create and Buy Now**.

## Step 3: Access Your Server

Hetzner will email you the IP, username, and password for your server.

Using your terminal, SSH into the server with the following command:

```bash
ssh root@<your-server-ip>
```

Replace `<your-server-ip>` with your actual IP. It will prompt for the password from Hetzner, and then you'll be asked to set a new root password. Save this password somewhere safe.

Coolify will begin installing automatically. Youâ€™ll receive a link to the Coolify dashboard, which should look something like this:

```arduino
http://<your-server-ip>:8000
```

## Step 4: Complete the Coolify Setup

Follow these steps in the Coolify dashboard:

1. Open the link to your Coolify instance and complete the registration.
2. Click **Get Started** and follow any prompts.
3. When prompted, select **Localhost** as the server.
4. Name your project and continue to **Add Resource**, linking your Git repository (a public repository is used in this example).
5. Click **Check Repository** to verify it.
6. Select **localhost** when asked which server to use, then proceed to **Deploy** and let Coolify build and serve your app.

If everything is set up correctly, your website should be live on the generated Coolify link.

## Step 5: Setting Up a Custom Domain for Coolify

Go to your domain provider's management dashboard and edit the DNS settings:

- Add an **A record** pointing your domain to your Hetzner serverâ€™s IP.
- In Coolify, go to **Settings** and set the instanceâ€™s domain to `https://coolify.<your-domain>`. For example, if your domain is `fplstats.live`, use `https://coolify.fplstats.live`.
- Hit **Save** and wait a few minutes for the DNS to propagate.

Now, you can access Coolify using your custom domain.

## Step 6: Linking Your App to the Domain

1. In Coolify, navigate to your projectâ€™s configuration dashboard.
2. Replace the autogenerated domain with your custom domain (include both `www` and non-`www` versions separated by commas).
3. Click **Save** and then **Redeploy** to apply the changes.
4. Afterward, return to your domainâ€™s DNS settings:

- Add an **A record** pointing to your server IP for both your root domain and `www` subdomain.
- Wait a few minutes, and your site should be live on your custom domain.

## Step 7: Set Up a Firewall

For added security, set up a firewall on Hetzner:

1. Go to **Firewalls** in the Hetzner dashboard and create three inbound rules for common ports (e.g., 80, 443, and SSH).
2. Apply these rules to your server under the **Resources** tab.
3. Once the firewall is enabled, Coolify will only be accessible via your custom domain (`https://coolify.<your-domain>`), ensuring secure HTTPS access as Coolify manages the SSL certificates automatically.

## Wrap-Up

In this guide, we created a Hetzner server with Coolify, set up a custom domain, and configured firewall rules for secure access. This setup allows you to self-host and manage your applications efficiently.
